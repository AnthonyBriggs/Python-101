# Python-101

Code sample grab bag which I'll be using for my tutorial at PyCon AU 2017

This is a collection of small to medium sized programs that I've written 
or found lying around the internet over the years. Some of them are 
good, others are ... not so good: quick hacks or proof of concept 
scripts. But all of them should be interesting or useful in some way, 
even if you're just learning to program. 

I may add to this if I find or write other useful little things, or if
you know of something that I can include, let me know.


## Contents

### bad_tweet

Download a list of someone's followers, so that you can block them (or something else?). Used on some of the usual suspects on Twitter, so that I don't have to see Nazi garbage.

### chat2

A simple(ish) campfire or slack-style web app, written in bottle.py and using websockets

### hello_python_source_py3

The source code from my book, *Hello! Python*, mostly updated for Python 3 and modern libraries.

### noise

A random noise wav generator. Can make white, brown, pink, pink-brown and perlin noise.

### particle toys

**grav**
Solar system "simulator". Particles in orbit, over time they (sort of) stick together and make a solar system.
  
**repulser**
An electron-style simulator. Particles repel each other, but can only get so far apart.

### passwords

A couple of scripts that I've used to generate secure passwords.

### planetcute

Some simple game-like toys that I made with pyglet and Daniel Cook's PlanetCute graphic set (http://www.lostgarden.com/2007/05/dancs-miraculously-flexible-game.html)

### pydome

A geometry program to calculate geodesic dome strut lengths. Works from first principles, so you can go arbitrarily high, eg. 10v

### domain_hosts_list.py

A script to test a server / website migration. Hits a list of web sites, checks for common Django misconfigurations.

### fizzbuzz

Lots of fizzbuzz examples in Python

### maths_multiplication

Generate multiplication problems for my kids to practice with.

### maths_problems

Generate BIMDAS-style problems for my kids to practice with.

### maze_generator.py

Generate mazes using a depth-first search.

### twitterfavlinks.py

Scrape your favorites and download all of the URLs

### world.py

An attempt at creating a fractal world. The idea is to move half the map up or down randomly, over time it looks more like a real landscape.
