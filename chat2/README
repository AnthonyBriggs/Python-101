Chat-thing
----------

Simple, free software chat program, a'la Slack, Campfire or Flowdock,
written in Python 3.5 with as few dependencies as possible.

Chat-thing is currently pre-alpha - it's stable, but not all of the 
features that you would expect from a chat program are here yet. You
can definitely use it to chat to people though, and it does links and
kitten gifs :)

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via 
<anthony.briggs@gmail.com> and I'll do my best to answer.

Chat thing is released under the GNU Affero Public License v3, you can
find a copy here if you don't have one with this README:
(http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.txt). AGPLv3 is GPLv3 with an extra
paragraph in section 13, so that you can download a copy even when you 
use this software over a network.
