# Python 101 tutorial

These are the slides written for the Python 101 presentation, given at
Pycon AU 2017. They're using remark.js, and I've included a template
as well, in case it's useful for someone who wants to give their own
talk.


# Post-mortem

(caveat - this is mainly my thoughts, and I won't know for sure
 until I see responses to the survey. It's possible I'm being slightly
 pessimistic)
 
I've called this presentation v1, because, while I think it covers all 
(or at least most) of the python bases, it's a little too fast for 
*really* new programmers, and a little too slow for experienced (but 
non-Python) ones. It was originally written for the latter group, but 
in the final mix there were quite inexperienced people too.

In the Python-101 tutorial, this meant that the experienced programmers
dominated the questions, and the section 2 took until after morning tea
to finish. I chopped out section 3, kind of rushed through the classes
and then worked through some of the Hello Python wumpus examples, but
I think that was ultimately a bit much for the poor attendees, and 
ended up being a bit dull.

I think it's a good place to start modifying for a v2 tutorial though,
but it should maybe jump straight into the programming part, instead
of a monolithic section 2 and then programming. A worked example that 
gets extended would probably work, I may do something along those lines?

Watch this space (or let me know if you're interested in something along
those lines or if there are other example topics you'd like to see)
