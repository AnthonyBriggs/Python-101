Hello Python! Source code for Python 3.

This is the source code for Hello Python!, written by Anthony Briggs, and
available from <http://manning.com/briggs/>. These programs have been 
converted to Python 3 (see the attached converter script) and seem to work
for the most part, which is a pleasant surprise. In any case, caveat emptor,
etc. and bug reports are welcome.

For some of this code you'll need to install beautifulsoup4, pyglet and twisted

pip install beautifulsoup4 pyglet twisted

Twisted also claims to need Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 on Windows:

    (I haven't tested this one yet)

This was originally released under the BSD license, so that you're free to
extend and adapt the code here for anything that you like, provided that you 
attribute it correctly.

Be warned that there are some bugs and limitations in this code; you'll want to
read the corresponding chapters for a full discussion. This is partly due to 
laziness, and partly so that there are 'loose threads' and easy low hanging 
fruit which new programmers can get their teeth into. Fixing bugs and adding
features will teach you far more about programming than simply reading code.
