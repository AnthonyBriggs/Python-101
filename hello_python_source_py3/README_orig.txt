Hello Python! Source code.

This is the source code for Hello Python!, written by Anthony Briggs, and
available from http://manning.com/briggs/. It's released under the BSD license,
so that you're free to extend and adapt it for anything that you like, provided
that you attribute it correctly.

Be warned that there are some bugs and limitations in this code; you'll want to
read the corresponding chapters for a full discussion. This is partly due to 
laziness, and partly so that there are 'loose threads' and easy low hanging 
fruit which new programmers can get their teeth into. Fixing bugs and adding
features will teach you far more about programming than simply reading code.
