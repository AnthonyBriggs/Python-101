# About me

## Background
--

 - I had home computers when growing up: C64, Amiga, PCs
--

 - Wrote simple programs for fun (basic), troubleshooting
--

 - Started out working as IT support
--

 - I learned on the job and worked up to sysadmin
---

# About me

## Meanwhile...

 - I'd been playing an online game called Atlantis
--

 - Fiddly, play-by-email wargame - lots of turns, orders, diplomacy, messages

# About me

## Meanwhile...

 - I'd been playing an online game called Atlantis
 - Fiddly, play-by-email wargame - lots of turns, orders, diplomacy, messages
 - I wrote a lot of code to automate GMing it
--

 - and then to combine maps to share with alliance members
--

 - and then to automate playing the boring bits

--
 - (and called it Genghis)
--

 - like, *lots and lots* of code
--

 - ...and that gave me enough experience to land a job programming python
 
???
It sounds like I launced a career off the back of one trivial game, but 
in hindsight writing these sorts of apps was a good intro to business programming:
downloading, parsing, data storage, building a model, 

---

# About me

## Ultimately

 - I've been working in Python around Melbourne ever since
--

 - I started the original Melbourne PUG
--

 - And wrote Hello(!) Python in 2010-2012
---

# Teaching

## How I teach

 - Observation: "Old programmers" never sat down and read a tutorial
--

 - No internet
--

 - Limited documentation
--

 - Needed to experiment
---

# Teaching

## What this means

 - Start with small programs and build up from there
--

 - You won't understand everything
--

 - Human brains and memory are associative
--

 - There'll be a point where the dots start "joining up" 
--

 - Note taking and journalling can be important: write down questions as you think of them
--

 - Questions lead to more questions
--

 - No questions means that you haven't understood the thing :)

# Who's in the class?

## Survey results

???
A mix of new devs and experienced ones, I'll try to keep things interesting, but not leave too many people behind

We're going to be learning some simple stuff to start, then moving on to automating email, reading csv files and web scraping

# Tutorial plan

 - 3 hour format with a half hour break for morning tea
--

 - 9AM-10.30AM and 11AM-12.30AM
--

 - 6 x 25 minute sessions:
   - Intro (5 mins)
   - 5-10 mins explanation
   - Example code and/or experimentation
   - 5 min question time
   
--

But this will depend on how the class is going. I might throw in more explanations or demos if things go quickly or slowly

---

# Sessions

 - 1) This session! Introduction, background and getting started
--

 - 2) Basic syntax of Python
--

 - 3) Useful libraries - 3rd party and standard
--

 - Morning tea
--

 - 4) Classes
--

 - 5) Packaging and deployment, Python 2 vs. 3, ???
--

 - 6) Where to from here?

--

These are a rough guide. We may go slower or faster, or end up doing different things towards the end.

# Python overview

## What's so great about Python?

---

# Python overview

## Python is pragmatic

 - It was built to _do things_ from the very start
--

 - by professional programmers with a professional process
--

 - It's pretty fast ("fast enough")
--

 - It's got a nice, clean syntax

---

# Python overview

## Python is pragmatic

 - You can do wild things if you need to, like monkey patching
--

 - but don't.
--

 - Python strikes a balance between robustness, reliability, maintainability...
--

 - and getting things done.

---

# Python overview

## Easy syntax

 - white space indentation
 - lack of brackets / weird punctuation
 - pretty good std lib
 - duck typing
 - underscores and dunderscores
--

 - all things that will help speed you up, but without being unmaintainable
---

# Python overview

## not srs biznis

 - named after Monty Python
 - Guido's time machine
 - RKM's series of puns for BeeWare
 - Open a Python prompt, type "import this"
 - or "from future import braces"

We're making sure that everyone's clear to go before the next section. If you get stuck on any of these things, Winnie, Srinath and I will help you out.
- Make sure that you can open a *REPL* (Python prompt)
- Download (and unzip) the code samples and exercises from github: http://github.com/AnthonyBriggs/Python-101
- Try and run the fizzbuzz.py .red[*] script in the root folder
  - you can double click it
  - or open a terminal and try it from the command line:
  
  ```bash
  python-101> python fizzbuzz.py
  ```

  ## Help
]
.right-column[
  In a Python prompt, you can use the ```help(thing)``` command to see help on a particular function. It'll show 'docstrings', which are included in Python functions and modules to describe what they do.
  
  ```python
  >>> help(list)
Help on class list in module builtins:

class list(object)
 |  list() -> new empty list
 |  list(iterable) -> new list initialized
 |                      from iterable's items
 |
 |  Methods defined here:
 |
 |  __add__(self, value, /)
 |      Return self+value.
```

.right-column[
  If there's an error in a Python program and it can't work out what to do, you'll get a **traceback**. Also known as an exception.
  
  Try running `fizzbuzz_broken.py`

```python
python 101\codes> python .\fizzbuzz_broken.py
Fizzbuzz
1
2
Fizz
4
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ".\fizzbuzz_broken.py", line 8, in <module>
    print(Buzz)
NameError: name 'Buzz' is not defined
```

Whoops.

  Here's a big flowchart of common Python errors, and probable fixes for them.
  
  ![Python traceback debugging flowchart](img/python_traceback_flowchart.png)
  
  There's a larger (PDF) version at https://pythonforbiologists.com/29-common-beginner-errors-on-one-page/

  You can use it to fix the error in `fizzbuzz_broken.py`, but don't do that just yet

  Even better than fixing errors is preventing them from happening. Python has a style guide called PEP8.
  
  If you don't have it already, install pylint:
  
  `pip install pylint`
  
  (there's also one called flake8)
  
  ```bash
python 101\codes> pylint .\fizzbuzz_broken.py
No config file found, using default configuration
************* Module fizzbuzz_broken
E: 10,14: Undefined variable 'Buzz' (undefined-variable)

--------------------------------------------------------
Your code has been rated at 3.75/10 
    (previous run: 3.75/10, +0.00)
```

  Finally, if you *really* want to master something, the best way is to teach it to someone else. They have a different perspective, and will ask different questions.
  
  If you see your neighbor having trouble with something, help them out! Or ask them for help if you're stuck.
  
  Myself, Winnie and Srinath are here to help too.
