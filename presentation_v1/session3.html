# "Batteries Included"

## Python has lots of libraries

## Like, tons. That's not counting PyPI

--
## And it's hard to know where to start
---

# What even is a library anyway?

## What's a library?

A bunch of pre-written code that you can pull into your program.

The simplest versions of a library are just one file, or a directory with an `__init__.py` file in it.
]
--
.right-column[
There are a couple of ways to import and use them.

```
import random
random.choice((1,2,3,4,5,6))
```
]

.right-column[
```
from random import choice
choice((1,2,3,4,5,6))
```
]
--
.right-column[
```
from random import *
choice((1,2,3,4,5,6))
```
Don't do this last one unless the library supports it!

## Caveats
]
--
.right-column[
**Circular imports** 

If you import library A into B, and then B into A, you'll get a circular import (actually, an `AttributeError`. The solution is usually to pull the common code out into a third library, or merge the two.
]
--
.right-column[
**Library Shadowing** 

If you create a library with the same name as a built-in, you won't be able to import the built-in: it'll just load the local version.
]
---
.left-column[
  ## Libraries
]
.right-column[
## Testing libraries

One thing that you'll see used quite often is to be able to test your library (or run it as a script) and import it separately.

When you import a library, it'll run everything in the file.
]
--
.right-column[
To avoid that, you can use the `__name__ == '__main__'` trick.

```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # do things you don't want to do on import
```
]
---

  ## Libraries
  ## Using classes
]
.right-column[
## Creating classes

Most of the Python libraries use classes. We look at them in detail after lunch, but they're straightforward if you're just using them.
]

???
 (We've already used lots of them, eg. when looking at string methods)
--
.right-column[
Class instances can be returned from library functions

```
>>> import datetime
>>> now = datetime.datetime.now()
>>> now
datetime.datetime(2017, 8, 2, 21, 10, 3, 271597)
>>> type(now)
<class 'datetime.datetime'>
```
]
--
.right-column[
Or you can import the class and create instances directly.
```
>>> tut_start = datetime.datetime(2017, 8, 3, 9, 0, 0, 0)
>>> tut_start
datetime.datetime(2017, 8, 3, 9, 0)
>>> type(tut_start)
<class 'datetime.datetime'>
```
]

---
.left-column[
  ## Libraries
  ## Using classes
]
.right-column[
## Using class instances

The object that you create from a class is called a Class Instance. It stores specific data like day, month, year, and you can also poke at it with class methods.

```
>>> tut_start.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
'2017-08-03'
>>> tut_start.replace(minute=10)
datetime.datetime(2017, 8, 3, 9, 10)
        # returns a new time
```

This is the case for everything in Python, though - numbers, lists, dictionaries, etc. Libraries are just a little more obvious about it.

# Ok, now let's look at some libraries

# Libraries

## I've split these by function 

### .pull-left[ General programming ]

### Data storage

### .pull-left[ Web clients ]

### Web serving

### .pull-left[ Email ]

### Command line

### .pull-left[ UI and games ]

### Anything else?

# Programming

## os, sys, os.path, os.walk

`os` and `os.path` are used for all sorts of file handling and manipulation: copy, delete, create directories, permissions, testing paths

`sys` is mainly used for command line arguments (`sys.argv`) and exiting your program (`sys.exit()`)

`os.walk` will recurse over a whole directory and return all the files and directories

Lots of examples of these in the code samples

---
# Programming

## collections

Has extra data structures that can be useful in some situations

`defaultdict` is a dictionary that will create new entries rather than raise a `KeyError`

`namedtuple` is a lightweight data storage class

```
>>> Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
>>> p = Point(11, y=22)
>>> p.x
11
```
---
# Programming

## random

Not just for random numbers, you can shuffle lists, pick a random choice.

## sha / hexdigest

Useful for testing identities of things (duplicate files, images)
---
# Programming

## pprint

Handy debugging tool, makes data structures much more readable.

```
>>> pp = pprint.PrettyPrinter(indent=4)
>>> pp.pprint(stuff)
```

## logging

Much easier than rolling your own (or print debugging in production)

```
import logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='example.log',level=logging.INFO)
logging.debug("This message won't go to the log file")
logging.warning("This will, though")
```
---
# Programming

## testing: unittest, doctest, py.test

`unittest` is based on the Java package, and has a very similar feel.

`doctest` runs tests from the class or function's docstring.

`py.test` is a 3rd party package which is a more lightweight, Pythonic version of unittest.

```
def inc(x):
    return x + 1

def test_answer():
    assert inc(3) == 5
```

---
# Data storage

## json

Turns dictionaries into JSON structures (slightly different dictionaries) and back again

For configuration, you can just import a dictionary from a `config.py` file. 

???
dictionary.__repl__()

---
# Data storage

## csv

If you need to work with business types, or interoperate with something. It's kind of a linga franca of legacy systems.

Just watch out for Excel autoconverting things. And if you're using Python 2, install unicodecsv

---
# Data storage

## sqlite

For structured data, where you need some normalisation, speed or slight multithreading, but don't want a full database.

There's a 3rd party library called peewee which puts a lightweight ORM on top of sqlite.

There are libraries for Postgres, MySQL, Oracle, etc. too, though.

---
# Data storage

## Others

There are other formats, like YAML or Pickle, but don't use them if you can help it.

## TinyDB

A lightweight NoSQL library, but not thread safe. Haven't tried it yet, but I plan to.

---
# Web 

## Python web libraries 

Builtins are generally kind of odd and split up. 
- `urllib` for the request
- `http.cookiejar` for cookie handling
- `html.escape` for escaping html strings

Requests is very good for general web client stuff.

---
# Web 

## Parsing

Hard to go past BeautifulSoup. It'll parse pretty much any web page.

If you know that you have decent markup, then the built in libraries, `html`, `xml.etree`, `xml.dom`, `xml.sax` work pretty well.

I've heard good things about zeep if you need to handle SOAP and WSDL, but I haven't used it.

---
# Web

## Serving

For lightweight servers (eg. serving a simple API or app), Bottle and Flask do very well - especially if paired with something like Peewee.

Beyond a certain point though you'll want Django, otherwise you'll just end up with a badly implemented version of the other half of Django, just written in Flask.

---
# Web

## Templating

Hard to go past jinja2. It's easy to use, very similar syntax to Django.

You could probably get away with f-strings, but it depends on your application and where it's going.

---
# Email

Python's standard library has  has implementations for most mail things - `email`, `smtplib`, `poplib`, `imaplib`

There's an example of composing and sending a MIME email in the Hello Python source (Chapter 5)

Getmail is a 3rd party mail client written in Python, if you need to download email from somewhere.

---
# Command line

## arguments

argparse is the standard option, supports lots of different argument types

```
import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Short sample app')

parser.add_argument('-a', action="store_true", default=False)
parser.add_argument('-b', action="store", dest="b")
parser.add_argument('-c', action="store", dest="c", type=int)

print(parser.parse_args(['-a', '-bval', '-c', '3']))
```

If you only need a couple of options though, you can just check sys.argv
```
if '--test' in sys.argv:
    # do test stuff
```
---
# Command line

# commands

`shlex.split` is an obscure library, but will split up strings according to shell syntax, handling quotes and (I think) backslashes and escapes.

I use it in the adventure modules in Hello Python, but it's generally useful.

```
>>> import shlex
>>> shlex.split("attack 'large orc'")
['attack', 'large orc']
```

---
# Shiny things

# Games

The main two packages are PyGame and Pyglet. Pygame is more established, Pyglet is a bit newer and more Pythonic. They're both good, there are several examples in the code repository.

# User Interfaces

WxWindows is the normal recommendation if you want something native-ish.

For multiplatform, there are other systems like Toga and Kivy. Toga is new and relatively untested, Kivy is better (but more complex from what I've seen).

???
        
    - (EX) simple pygame / pyglet example (eg. grav, repulser)
    - (EX) Sending MIME emails?
    - (EX) scrape web site
    - (EX) PyHP (if I can finish it :) )
