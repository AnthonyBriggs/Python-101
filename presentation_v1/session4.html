# Classes

## Rough theory

You can think of Classes as a rubber stamp - once you've carved it, you can use it to stamp out lots of copies (instances).

Classes usually have functions, and Instances will have stored data.

???
This is the rough, 90% correct version :) Some classes will be different

# Classes

## Rough theory

There's no difference between a method and a function. The only catch is that a class method will have a leading argument called `self` (by convention), which Python will set as the class instance.

```
class Player(object):
    def __init__(self, location):
        self.name = "Player"
```

You can even insert functions to monkeypatch instances (don't do that).

# Classes

## Rough theory

Classes and instances have an internal dictionary, called __dict__, which is a store of functions and variables that belong to that class or instance.

When you access an attribute, Python looks it up in the instance, then the class, then any other plces, like parent classes.

```
>>> datetime.datetime
<class 'datetime.datetime'>
>>> tut_start = datetime.datetime(2017, 8, 3, 9, 0, 0, 0)
>>> tut_start.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
'2017-08-03'
```

Talk about dunder methods

Talk about how the data and methods are stored in the datetime example.

# Classes

## Inheritance

Class inheritance works in a similar way. You can declare classes to be copies of another class, then change the bits that are different.

```
class Player(object):
    def __init__(self, location):
        self.name = "Player"
```

```
import player

class Monster(player.Player):
    def __init__(self, location, name, description):
        player.Player.__init__(self, location)
        self.name = name
```

???
Look at monster / player class in Hello Python? Or the skippable API in bad_tweets?

Maybe talk about this being a bad design? Mobile -> Player and Monster?

# Classes

## Inheritance

A better way to handle initialisation is to use the `super()` function, like this:

```
class Monster(player.Player):
    def __init__(self, location, name, description):
        super().__init__(self, location)
```

`super()` will automatically find the parent class, and maintain the right order when looking up attributes in more complex classes.

```
class UrukHai(Mobile, Combatant, AllianceMember, Magician):
    def __init__(self, location, name, description, items, alliance):
        super().__init__(self, location, name, description, items, alliance)
```

Having more than one parent class is called Multiclassing, or a Mixin class.

# Classes

## Dunder methods

Internal Python class methods are often called "Dunder methods" (for Double UNDERscore)

There's nothing special about the functions or attributes themselves, but they're the 'hooks' that the Python interpreter will use in certain situations.

`__init__` is used to populate an instance's data 

`__str__` will return a printable string identifying the instance

`__repr__` returns a code-based representation of the instance

`__doc__` will return the docstring for the class or function

`__dict__` has all of the methods and attributes for that class or instance.

---
# Classes

## Attribute access

There are a few special methods called around class attribute access too.

- `__getattribute__(self, key)`, called to return an attribute

- `__getattr__(self, key)`, called to return an attribute, *if* `key` isn't found.

- `__setattr__(self, key, value)`, called to set an attribute, *if* `key` isn't found.

- `__delattr__(self, key)` to delete

- `__dir__` should return the equivalent of `dir()`

Mailsnake (https://github.com/Leftium/mailsnake/blob/master/mailsnake/mailsnake.py) is a good example
???
getattribute can be dangerous

---
# Classes

## Copying other types of object

If you want to write a class which behaves like some of the built in classes, there are methods for that, too. Dictionaries use the following methods

- `__getitem__(self, key)` to look up a value in the dictionary

- `__setitem__(self, key, value)` to set a value

- `__delitem__(self, key)` to delete a value

- `__missing__(self, key)` to handle or provide a value for a missing key
