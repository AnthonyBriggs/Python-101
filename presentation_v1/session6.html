# Where to from here?

--

## This is only Python 101, there's lots more

---
# Some avenues for learning more

## (You're here at PyCon, that's a good start)

---
# Mailing lists

Python have several lists: 

- `tutor`
- `python-help`
- `python-dev` 

There are a few special interest ones too (eg. XML)

You should also sign up for your local Python user group's mailing list, and ask questions there too, either in person or via email.

---
# Books

There are a wealth of free and paid-for books available on Python. Here are some useful free ones:

- https://djangobook.com/the-django-book/

- http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.pdf

- https://automatetheboringstuff.com/

- http://www.openbookproject.net/py4fun/ (This is more a series of short articles)

# Read code

Most programmers spend their time reading code, rather than writing it ("What does this function do/why is it buggy?"), so it makes sense to get better at reading.

It doesn't have to be a huge application either - there are lots of shorter code "snippets" around.

---
# Write code

Even if it's just a fun script or small game, solving a real problem. Figure out small problems in your life, figure out how you can solve them, and write it.

Or volunteer to help out with an established project - some will have small issues set aside for new programmers.

(Hint: there are sprints on Monday and Tuesday)

--
## REwrite code

If you've got something that you think you could do better (it may even be something that you've written), trying to fix it or rewrite it will make you a better programmer (or it'll show you why the original programmer did things a certain way).

---
# Teach someone

If you want to master something, the fastest way to do it is to try to teach someone (once you've learned it yourself)

--
# Document code

Documentation is just teaching at a distance :) If you're going to document something, you have to understand it in detail. And in the course of explaining it, you'll often realise how you can make it better, or find bugs and missing edge cases.

# Plug: Pyweek

Pyweek is a local game development "competition" run by Richard Jones, where you write a small game in a week (A lower pressure version of Ludum Dare).

# Come and talk to me!

## No seriously, if you've got questions about the code, or something in the tutorial, come and see me and I'll see if I can help.
